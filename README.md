**ScreenSlaver.py** turns your IPad into a Screen-Slaver (remember Incredibles II from PIXAR) with 1 simple Pythonista script.

The shader code is from https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdyBRt.
I just tweaked it a little bit.

It will cause your iPad to heat up during prolonged use.
At the same time, it also demonstrates the incredible performance of the graphics chip inside.
I would advise against prolonged use of this software without the power supply connected, as the battery life may suffer. 

Installation
------------

1. Install Pythonista on your IPad -> https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pythonista-3/
2. Create a new .py file in the App and copy this script into it.
3. Hit "run" and get blown away.

The meaning of it
-----------------

This is simply colour therapy, which we need in these difficult times.
Especially now in the northern hemisphere where it is winter.
It's at least better than the standard WIndows 11 desktop background.
