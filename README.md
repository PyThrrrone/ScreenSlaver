# ScreenSlaver
Turn your IPad into a Screen-Slaver (remember Incredibles II from PIXAR) with 1 simple Pythonista script.
Become a painter and sell the output of this script!

The shader code is from https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdyBRt.
I just tweaked it a little bit.

It will cause your iPad to heat up during prolonged use.
At the same time, it also demonstrates the incredible performance of the graphics chip inside.
I would advise against prolonged use of this software without the power supply connected, as the battery life may suffer.
