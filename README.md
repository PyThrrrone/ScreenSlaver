Turns your IPad into a Screen-Slaver (remember Incredibles II from PIXAR) with 1 simple Pythonista script.

The shader code is from https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tdyBRt.
I just tweaked it a little bit.

It will cause your iPad to heat up during prolonged use.
At the same time, it also demonstrates the incredible performance of the graphics chip inside.
I would advise against prolonged use of this software without the power supply connected, as the battery life may suffer. 

Installation
------------

1. Install Pythonista on your IPad
2. Create a new .py file in the App and copy this script into it.
3. Hit "run" and get blown away.
